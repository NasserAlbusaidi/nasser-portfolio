## 🛰️ SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES

### 1. **[BOOT_SEQUENCE]**
A custom-built cinematic entry experience using Framer Motion and procedural animations to simulate a high-tech system startup.

### 2. **[TACTICAL_HUD]**
A persistent telemetry overlay that tracks real-time training metrics, bio-monitor data (HR, Sleep, HRV), and mission status.

### 3. **[VISUAL_MANIFESTO]** (Garage)
A curated asset gallery showcasing RAW photography. Features automated EXIF metadata extraction and a grayscale-to-chromatic hover effect.

### 4. **[MISSION_ANALYTICS]**
Precision data visualization of training loads using Recharts. Includes:
- **Heatmap Calendar**: Daily mission intensity.
- **Bio Monitor**: Wellness telemetry (Sleep, Stress, Recovery).
- **Personal Records**: Tracking peak performance vectors.

### 5. **[GLOBAL_OPS]**
An interactive 3D Globe (powered by Mapbox GL v3) visualizing global activity paths and territory control across Muscat and beyond.

### 6. **[SECURE_ACCESS]**
Authenticated admin console for remote asset management, encrypted via Firebase Auth and protected by a tactical pin-pad interface.
